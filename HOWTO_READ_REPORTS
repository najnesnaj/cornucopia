HOWTO read and understand a report
----------------------------------

#Description

The head of the document contains a lot of information as found on yahoo finance.
This is only there for reference, and it includes a description of the company

#A value analysis

This shows the health of a company : 
- does it have debt
- does it grow
- how is it priced


To complete you'll find the quarter - EBIT data.
This is used to calculated the new P/E.
Which could be an indicator of price-evolution.



#insider data

- in my humble and maybe naive worldview, high rank insider buying is OK


#analist fortune telling


the market price is compared to march 2020 (COVID) and to analist estimate (yahoo)

- I consider it OK if pricelevel is not a lot above COVID-pricing
- if it's a lot cheaper than analists would like, maybe a buy?


#technical analysis

you can skip this, I do not believe in it, but I like the graphics ....

#risc

P/E > 15, debt, assets vs liabilities, insider selling ....

#comparison
